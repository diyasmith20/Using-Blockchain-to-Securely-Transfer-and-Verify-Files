# Using-Blockchain-to-Securely-Transfer-and-Verify-Files

<strong>Overview</strong>

Any blockchain network hosted on the high-assurance platform is good for secured information exchange across all network safety domains — for instance, exchanging unclassified data between a classified as well as an unclassified network. Though, when the data exchanged consists of video, audio, images, or other bigger file content, the crypto-intensive blockchain network gets an enormous performance hit. So, whenever bigger files are associated, the <a href="https://www.brevitysoftware.com/using-blockchain-to-securely-transfer-and-verify-files/" target="_blank"><strong>blockchain development solution</strong></a> is to pair the blockchain guard with any conventional file-transfer guard and avoid the blockchain operation hit and improve the conventional file guard’s accountability, control, and attribution.

<strong>Problem with Files in the Blockchain</strong>

The blockchain development excels in offering a particular, assured view of the asset-related transactional data to all the authorized participants in the secured business network channel — offering assured and complete transactional provenance and attribution. But, computationally-heavy cryptographic operations have become very expensive as well as storage volumes blowup when big files are written to every ledger across the distributed blockchain networks. So, the best practice is storing only a digital signature or hash of the larger files in the ledger to keep a file off-ledger. That’s how, a file’s hash in the unchallengeable ledger offers assurance about the integrity and provenance of the file content doesn't matter where the real file is stored, and the storage and ledger performance remains optimal.

<strong>Blockchain File Transfer Solutions</strong>

An efficient and elegant <a href="https://www.brevitysoftware.com/services/web-design/" target="_blank"><strong>web development solution</strong></a> is to employ the blockchain ledger combined with the conventional file-transfer guard. The safety controls of a transactional blockchain ledger boost the safety controls of a conventional file-transfer protected by offering accountability and transactional context. And the conventional file-transfer guard enriches and extends derivation by offering the file-transfer information to the related asset’s ledger entries.

After release permission, a permitted intelligence transaction as well as supporting proof file are submitted to a cross-domain intelligence blockchain channel as well as file-transfer cross-domain guard, separately. The blockchain promise event signals a file-transfer guard to validate and move the files. Not shown is the option of also recording the file’s guard-produced movement events in a blockchain ledger to offer a complete picture about the evidential file attribution.

The same information flow is appropriate to the cross-domain use cases whereas off-ledger data like larger files or Personally-Identifying Information or PII should be kept coordinated with on-ledger data.

<strong>How Valuable It is for you?</strong> 

Whenever paired with the conventional cross-domain file transfer guard, the advantages of blockchain cross-domain solutions extend to a traditional guard. Precisely, it offers a single-shared view about every asset through its lifecycle despite the network format or domain, ledger-based or file. The provenance and accountability of the file-based data are immutably preserved related to other asset data preserved in the transactional ledger. This ledger data for any provided channel is equal.

It also offers auditable control as well as oversight of the file-based asset’s data right through the blockchain development. The digital signature or file content hash comprised in the blockchain business proposal, transaction commit, and endorsement procedures, offers auditable liability of precisely what content has been approved by whom to share and transfer using a file transfer guard.

The Future of Blockchain business

For different businesses, smart contracts and <a href="https://www.brevitysoftware.com/using-blockchain-to-securely-transfer-and-verify-files/" target="_blank"><strong>blockchain development</strong></a> open the doors for many new opportunities. Amongst all crowd sourcing methods, blockchain is the best. It is still a futuristic concept however, it is an all-inclusive solution for the investment management in which, people can get payments and shares from the companies they have invested in. Certainly, the possibilities for blockchain are extensive and they are still expanding as the technology is getting matured. So, you can anticipate some new and progressive use cases in the future.

Although for some businesses, smart contracts and blockchain may take some more time to familiarize, this technology shows enormous prospective for the business service industry as well as beyond. Today, amongst the inventors of smart contracts and blockchain include financial service titans, pharmaceutical enterprises, and e-commerce leaders.
